        <h2>About Me</h2>  
        <p>My name is Antonio de Leon. It's definitely a pleasure to meet you all from around the world. I'm currently an ALB degree candidate studying computer science. Currently, I'm taking three other courses (Data Structures and two other non-CS courses). I plan on applying to tech companies as a product manager and hope this course will strengthen my back-end skills and make me a more competitive candidate. I'm definitely looking forward to learn with you all!<br />
